## Privacy

- We do not store any of your location or calendar info.
- Your info belongs with you. The app gets the location from your device.
- The app can also sometimes, in cases of poor network, fetch your location info using a 3rd-party service known as Skyhook Wireless. Skyhook attempts to determine location using Wifi info.
- See Skyhook's privacy policy [here](https://www.skyhookwireless.com/privacy-policy).
- See Google's privacy policy [here](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/policies/).

## Logging

- If you are using the logging feature, you will notice that Squiggly records your device movements and also allows you to see the points on a map (tap the lat/lon coordinate).
- This information, however, is stored on your phone, and gets wiped when it reaches a certain size limit.
- We do not have any control over your device.
- We do not have this info on any servers, so please do not contact us with requests to track your lost phone etc.
